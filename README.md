# fling-start
## Python library for building single-file web applications.

Start makes it very easy to build python web applications in a single file.
It provides out-of-the-box implementations of the following patterns:

 * HTML-only loading screens
 * HTML-over-websockets for high-performance interactive web experiences
 * Install-at-runtime abuse of pip (to speed up the try-use-deploy loop)
 * Configure-at-runtime dynamic admin interfaces for missing ENV VARs
 * (Half-done): Easy 'freeze' to static files for 'parboiled' web content
 * (TODO): Integrates with fling-hub for SSL-supported multiple apps on localhost
